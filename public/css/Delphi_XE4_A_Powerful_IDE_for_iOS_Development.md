In this article, we will explore some of the features and benefits of Delphi XE4 for iOS development, such as:
 
- iOS support for device, simulator, and app store deployment
- iOS support for standard and retina displays
- iOS styles, retina styles, and virtual keyboards
- Mobile form designer
- TWebBrowser component
- iOS ARC (automatic reference counting) for all TObject classes
- Platform services, notifications, and sensor components
- TListView component
- FireDAC universal data access components
- InterBase â IBLite and IBToGo

Let's take a closer look at each of these features and see how they can help you create amazing iOS apps with Delphi XE4.
  
## iOS support for device, simulator, and app store deployment
 
Delphi XE4 allows you to target iOS devices, such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch, as well as the iOS simulator. You can use the same code base and project files for both platforms, without any need for conditional compilation or platform-specific code. You can also use the same IDE features, such as debugging, refactoring, code completion, and code insight, for both platforms.
 
Delphi XE4 also supports app store deployment, which means you can easily create an IPA file that can be submitted to the Apple App Store for distribution. You can use the Deployment Manager to specify which files and resources should be included in the IPA file, as well as set the app icon, splash screen, bundle identifier, version number, and other metadata.
  
## iOS support for standard and retina displays
 
Delphi XE4 supports both standard and retina displays for iOS devices. Retina displays have a higher pixel density than standard displays, which means they can display sharper images and text. Delphi XE4 automatically scales your user interface elements to match the resolution of the device. You can also use different styles and images for standard and retina displays, by using the StyleBook component and suffixes like @2x or @3x.
  
## iOS styles, retina styles, and virtual keyboards
 
Delphi XE4 provides a set of predefined styles that you can apply to your user interface elements to give them a native look and feel on iOS devices. You can choose from different themes, such as Aqua Graphite or Jet Black. You can also customize the styles using the Style Designer tool or create your own styles from scratch.
 
Delphi XE4 also supports retina styles, which are optimized for retina displays. Retina styles have higher resolution images and fonts than standard styles. You can use the same StyleBook component to apply retina styles to your user interface elements.
 
Delphi XE4 also supports virtual keyboards on iOS devices. Virtual keyboards are software keyboards that appear on the screen when the user needs to enter text. Delphi XE4 automatically shows and hides the virtual keyboard when the user focuses or unfocuses an editable control. You can also control the type of virtual keyboard that appears by setting the KeyboardType property of the control.
  
## Mobile form designer
 
Delphi XE4 provides a mobile form designer that allows you to design your user interface for iOS devices. The mobile form designer shows a preview of how your user interface will look on different devices and orientations. You can also use different layouts to arrange your user interface elements according to different screen sizes and resolutions.
  
## TWebBrowser component
 
The TWebBrowser component allows you to display web content in your iOS apps. You can use it to show HTML pages or files from local or remote sources. You can also interact with the web content by using events and methods of the TWebBrowser component.
